A human just interacted with the following objects for the provided time in seconds:
</previous_interactions_string>.
So far, the last interaction with </last_interaction_sem> lasted for </last_interaction_duration> seconds.
In seconds, predict, how much longer the human will interact with the </last_interaction_sem>.

You can assume that the interaction will not last more than 60s in total.
Output in JSON format with the following structure:
{
    "reasoning": '''insert reasoning here''',
    "duration": '''X.X'''
}
