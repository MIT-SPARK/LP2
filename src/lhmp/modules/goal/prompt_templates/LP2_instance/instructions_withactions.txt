Predict the </width> different most likely next objects of interaction out of the above given objects.
Output your reasoning, based on the objects in the environment and the previous interactions, why objects may be the next step in a sequence of interactions.
Then predict </width> plausible interactions at the next timestep. All predicted objects have to be in the above environment!
Also predict the action that the human will perform with the object.
Output your answer in the following JSON format:
{
    "reasoning": '''insert reasoning here'''
    "predictions: [
        {
        "id": '''insert object ID here'''
        "object": '''insert object label here''',
        "action": '''insert action here''',
        "duration": '''insert duration as float value here''',
        "probability": '''insert probability of prediction here'''},
        ...
    ]
}
The length of the list of predictions should be </width>.
The probability should be a value from 1 to 10 where 10 means the object is the most likely next object of interaction.
The duration should represent the duration that the human will interact with the object in seconds (you can assume an interaction in general lasts between 1.0 and 60.0 seconds).
